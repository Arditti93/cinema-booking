# cinema-booking

Challenge:

An independent cinema company would like your assistance in creating a cinema booking system for their 3 screens.

* One 200 seater screen - 2D only
* One 150 seater screen - 3D only
* One 300 seater screen - 2D and 3D capable.

There is no database, so as soon as you refresh the page, your bookings for seats will reset. We will look at this issue in the backend portion of the bootcamp. :-)

Criteria:

* You can book up to 5 seats at a time
* Child, adult, senior, student tickets available
* Popcorn, hotdogs and other refreshments are available too
* No pre-booking yet
* Films can show in 2D or 3D but only in correct screens
* Prices are more expensive for 3D showings
